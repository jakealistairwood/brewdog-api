This project was developed using React and uses an API to fetch data and display it on the page. A user can interact with the application by: 

1) Using a searchbar that will allow the user to find the beer by name.
2) Various filter methods where the user can click on the buttons to filter their selection, .e.g.
    - By classic beers
    - By the ABV percentage.

The app is still under development as I need to work on making it more responsive across devices, adding extra filter selections and by adding Authorisation so that the user can sign-in and favourite their beer selections.
